# Splunk Demo

... or, "adventures in structured logging"

## Introduction

This project is a testbed for trying out a few things in an 
attempt to create a method for submitted structured logs into
a log aggregator - in this particular case, a Splunk HTTP Forwarder.

You may (or may not) find any of these items useful.  Maybe I'll 
have something interesting to say one day about all of this.
